You are members of an exploratory crew of astronauts who
are on a mission to establish a scout base for an imminent colonization
effort.

Unfortunately,
a rogue meteor has struck the main structure of the habitat, ruptured the hull of the base and destroyed the command
center.

You barely managed to escape
into the nearest dormitory quarters before full depressurization occurred.

Can you make it to the escape pod and survive?
