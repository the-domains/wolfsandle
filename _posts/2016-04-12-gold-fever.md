You received the tip of a lifetime! An old miner has been paying with only gold nuggets at the local saloon.

After he is found dead in his cabin, a large stash of gold was found under his bed with a coded map to the source of his riches - Spanish Gold.

You and your team of treasure seekers sneak into his cabin to solve the puzzle that can make you incredibly rich.

Can you solve the puzzle and find the gold, or will you fall to one of the traps designed by the greedy miner?
