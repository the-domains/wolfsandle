You received the tip of a lifetime! An old miner has been paying with only gold nuggets at the local saloon.

After he is found dead in his cabin, a large stash of gold was found under his bed with a coded map to the source of his riches - Spanish Gold.

You and your team of treasure seekers sneak into his cabin to solve the puzzle that can make you incredibly rich.
